# Ripple-Carry-Adder
A verilog implementation of a Ripple Carry Adder.
This adder includes cascaded full adders into its structure.Thus, the carry is generated at every full adder stage in a ripple-carry adder (RCA) circuit. 
The carry output at each full adder stage is forwarded to its next full adder and there applied as a carry input to it. This process continues up to its last full adder stage. So, each carry output bit is rippled to the next stage of a full adder, hence the name 'ripple carry'.
However, one of the most important cons of the RCA is, the final output is available only after the carry outputs are generated by each full adder stage and forwarded to its next stage. Thus, there remains a delay 
in geting the result using the Ripple Carry Adder.
