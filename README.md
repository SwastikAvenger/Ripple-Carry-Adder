# Ripple-Carry-Adder
A verilog implementation of a Ripple Carry Adder.
This adder includes cascaded full adders into its structure.Thus, the carry is generated at every full adder stage in a ripple-carry adder (RCA) circuit. 
The carry output at each full adder stage is forwarded to its next full adder and there applied as a carry input to it. This process continues up to its last full adder stage. So, each carry output bit is rippled to the next stage of a full adder, hence the name 'ripple carry'.

However, one of the most important cons of the RCA is, the final output is available only after the carry outputs are generated by each full adder stage and forwarded to its next stage. Thus, there remains a delay 
in geting the result using the Ripple Carry Adder.

To implement this project, one must design the half adder module by taking example from the HA_1bit module available in this repo. Then, design the full adder module using module instantiation method (Port Connection by Name method is preferrred over Ordered List, since if the order of the list in any module gets modified, the circuit will be have an improper design). 
Once the full adder is designed, declare some wire signals to store/transfer the carry output of each full adder to the next full adder. 
The final carry output is taken as the carry output of the final stage adder.
